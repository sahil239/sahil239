## 🙋‍♂️ Who Am I?

I'm a passionate Android developer with over **8 years** of experience building sleek, scalable, and super-satisfying mobile apps. From startups to global fintechs, I’ve led teams, squashed bugs, mentored devs, migrated legacy code (👋 Java, hello Kotlin!), and delivered apps that *just work*. Whether it's Jetpack Compose, MVVM, or some good ol’ `Log.d()`, I'm all about clean code, creative UI, and pushing pixels with purpose.

## 💼 Experience Snapshot

I've been slinging Android code for 8+ years across startups, fintech jungles, and med-tech missions 🧑‍💻. From crafting sleek Kotlin UIs with Jetpack Compose 🎨 to wrestling legacy Java code into the 21st century 🦖➡️🚀, I've done it all. I've led teams, mentored devs, debugged crashes at 2 AM (shoutout Firebase Crashlytics 🧯), and shipped apps that actually made it to the Play Store 🙌. I’ve danced with MVVM, wrestled with REST APIs☕⚔️. Whether it’s building from scratch or untangling spaghetti code, I bring clean vibes, clean code, and a touch of ✨fun✨ to everything I do.
